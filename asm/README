SkordalOS Assembler Functions
#############################

This folder contains various assembler functions used in the OS. They were
put in this folder because they are not considered a module of the operating
system in itself.

The functions are used by including asm/functions.h and linking to
libasm_functions. The linking is done automatically by the build process.
