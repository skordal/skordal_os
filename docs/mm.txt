SkordalOS Memory Manager
########################

The memory manager works by treating the memory as a linked list of memory
blocks. The first block is allocated after the MMU has been initialized.

At the start of each block is a small structure with information about
the size of the block and where its neighbours are. The neccessity of
having such a block causes a slight memory overhead, particularily when
allocating many small blocks of memory. It should, however, prevent
the memory from becoming too fragmented.

For now, allocation is O(n) in worst case, n being the number of memory
blocks. This will be improved later. Freeing memory is O(1).
