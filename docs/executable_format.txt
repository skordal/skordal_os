SkordalOS Executable Format
###########################

NOTE: This is very preliminary information, as the OS cannot actually
execute applications yet. Even so, at the moment the apps/ folder contains
a simple hello world application.

All executable files consists of three sections; text, data and bss.

At the beginning of the executable is the following header:
	Offset	Description
	0	Entry point address.
	4	Magic byte: 'S'
	| 5	Magic byte: 'O'
	| 6	Magic byte: 'S'
	| 7	Version of executable format, currently 1.
	8	Address of the start of the data section.
	12	Address of the start of the bss section.
	16	Address of the end of the executable.

All section addresses must be aligned to 4096. Shared libraries are not
supported.
