SkordalOS Readme
################

SkordalOS is a small, simple operating system for the BeagleBoard. It was 
created as a learning excercise for myself, but I hope it may be useful
for others.

To build SkordalOS, you will need:
	* Standard UNIX utilities, e.g. cp, rm, mkdir and possibly others.
	  Also important is make, without which the project will not build.
	* An arm-none-eabi toolchain. The build process uses gcc, ld, ar,
	  ranlib and objcopy from the toolchain.
	* Das U-Boot tools, specifically mkimage, to create the uImage.

When you have installed these tools, have a look in config.mk and see if
everything is to your liking. The build flags probably should not be 
changed, but you may try.

Now you type 'make'.

After a pretty short, or, depending on your hardware, long, wait, you should
have a uImage file in your skordal_os directory. This file may now be sent
to your BeagleBoard using minicom or loaded onto an SD-card for testing.
